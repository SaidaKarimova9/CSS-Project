        "To begin with, I will analyze the relationship between the number of Netflix subscribers and TV viewers in Italy. Following that, I will examine the correlation between Netflix revenue and TV viewership in Italy. Although the dataset is small, we can make preliminary predictions about the results even before conducting the correlation analysis. However, I chose to perform a correlation analysis as part of the statistical analysis process. This decision is motivated by the fact that accurately predicting the correlation for larger datasets in the future is not possible without performing analysis. Therefore, using correlation analysis becomes essential to ensure clear and reliable outcomes."
